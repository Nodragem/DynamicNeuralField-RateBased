The gain parameter can be seen as a thresolding softener/hardener.

Indeed when the gain parameter is high the sigmoid if hard.
Harder is the sigmoid and more we follow the matching law.
Softer it is and more we choose the good option, even when the difference is small.

Basically soft thresholding allows to take time in the decision making.
